# Football Teams App

## Development Setup

1. run 'npm start' to run 'webpack --watch'
    * webpack combines the js module files and does Babel transpiling
1. Use Atom dev-live-reload to view the app in browser/ CTRL+SHFT+3
1. Don't open dist/bundle.js, it crashes Atom. If you need to view errors, they should be listed as the orginal filename as I added "devtool: 'eval-source-map'," to webpack.config.js

At one point I had this all running on Webpack with:
- webpack-dev-server to start a server (didn't require atom live server)
- 'npm start' would run the local version of webpack-dev-server and also replace webpack
- all source files in an src dir, including index.html, css, js files.
- HtmlWebpackPlugin  so that the index.html can live in src file and still open automatically when you go to http://localhost:3000///
- devtool: 'eval-source-map'    so that errors in Chrome are displayed with the original filename, not the bundle.js file
- css loader
- path module for future deployment OS independence

However, Mustache broke and couldn't fix it so restored to this state. See my webpack notes to carry on with this


## About

App to record friendly football game winning points.
Points are recorded cumulatively, per player, so that at the end of the season you have a winning individual.

HTML, CSS, Javascript. Open index.html to begin.

- Generates two evenly matched random teams by selecting available existing players or adding players to the database first.
- Teams are evenly matched using each players' assigned skill rating.
- Game stats are recorded, including game date, teams, players, winning score, goal scorers.
- Cumulative stats are recorded for each player: total goals scored across the season and individual winning points (3 points for a win, 2 for a draw, 1 point for playing).
- Reports by player league score and total goals to determine a season winner.
- Players can be charged a nominal fee for lateness to games, which is recorded until paid up (not yet implemented).
- Data is stored in localStorage on the device and can be exported as raw JSON.

Designed for Karl; he plays a weekly game with his mates. The brief was:

- 17 mates, 1 game each week
- Each player is skill scored 1-3
- Each Tue everyone gets an email: who's in, who's out, They respond. - could this be online webapp, email reminder and they go on the website to RSVP.
- Just before the game, generate two evenly matched by ability teams
- Each week the teams should be different - the above should sort this?
- PrintTeams(playersRSVP) could generate a txt file to print to take to the game (or might need to regenerate on site?)
- win = 3, lose =1, draw = 2 (each person receives points)
- League table is per person, not per team
- Late charge = Â£1/min charge
- How much per game to play?
- Number of goals is also recorded
- Need to output the current stats to a text file? so that it can be emailed out?
- Show and update players if RSVP but no-show - maybe a forfeit for this?
- End of season lowest individual score pays for the whole meal out at a curry house!
