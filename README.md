Football teams app:

	- 17 mates, 1 game each week
	- Each player is skill scored 1-3
	- Each Tue everyone gets an email: who's in, who's out, They respond. - could this be online webapp, email reminder and they go on the website to RSVP.
	- Just before the game, generate two evenly matched by ability teams
	- Each week the teams should be different - the above should sort this?
	- PrintTeams(playersRSVP) could generate a txt file to print to take to the game (or might need to regenerate on site?)
	- win = 3, lose =1, draw = 2 (each person receives points)
	- League table is per person, not per team
	- Late charge = Â£1/min charge
	- How much per game to play?
	- Number of goals is also recorded
	- Need to output the current stats to a text file? so that it can be emailed out.
	- Show and update players if RSVP but no-show - maybe a forfeit for this?
	- End of season lowest individual score pays for the whole meal out at a curry house!
